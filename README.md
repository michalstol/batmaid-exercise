# Batmaid exercise

It is a recruitment exercise for Batmaid company. It is created based on CLI create-react-app with redux && typescript template.

## Launch application

You have two scripts "start" and "database". First, you need to run the "database" script. When the database is ready then run the "start" script.

## Database

Database is powered by the mock.json file. [Database - http://localhost:3001/jobs-data](http://localhost:3001/jobs-data)

## Response delay

You can change the delay in database response. Edit package.json file, locate the "database" script and after "--delay" change the value of the current delay. Rerun script.

## Fallback screen

To get the fallback screen just kill the "database" script and refresh the page. It is a really basic fallback screen.
